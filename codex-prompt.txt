Requirements:
1. Find 4-5 uci chess engine candidates not in the repo already with usable upstream binaries from their latest release (prefer variety).
2. Mirror each engine into this repo (`Jay-ArBrouillard/chessar-engine-index`) as release tag:
   - `<engine-slug>-<version>`
3. Normalize all mirrored assets to `.zip` for consistency:
   - Convert `.7z`, `.tar`, raw binaries, and `.exe` into `.zip`.
4. If upstream only has Windows binaries, generate a Linux binary when feasible and include both Linux and Windows zips.
5. Use explicit platform naming in release assets:
   - `*-linux.zip` and `*.exe.zip` (or equivalent unambiguous names).
6. Create/update docs page for each engine at:
   - `docs/<engine-slug>/<version>/index.html`
   - Separate Linux and Windows sections.
   - Every link must point to the mirrored GitHub release asset URL in this repo.
7. Keep `stockfish-18` as the repo's latest release (do not promote new engine releases to latest).
8. Validate final state:
   - Release exists
   - Assets uploaded
   - HTML links resolve to existing assets
9. Clean temp/download artifacts before finishing.

Output:
- List engines added, upstream source/tag used, mirrored release tags, asset names uploaded, docs files created/updated, and any blockers.

Operational guardrails:
1. Preflight checks before mirroring:
   - Confirm `gh` availability; if missing, use GitHub REST API with `curl`.
   - Confirm GitHub auth works before heavy work (for example: `GET /user` or create/delete a draft probe release).
   - Confirm latest release is `stockfish-18` before and after publishing.
2. Windows PowerShell + GitHub REST payloads:
   - For `POST`/`PATCH`, write JSON to a file and send with `--data-binary @payload.json`.
   - Avoid inline JSON strings in PowerShell for release APIs.
3. Release asset upload URL handling:
   - Always strip the upload URL template suffix `"{?name,label}"`.
   - Build upload URL as base + `?name=<escaped-asset-name>` using explicit string concatenation.
4. Credential handling safety:
   - Never print tokens or raw credential-manager output.
   - Keep credentials in memory only for API calls.
5. Validation must include:
   - Release tag exists.
   - Expected assets exist on release.
   - Every docs link points to this repo's mirrored release asset URL and resolves (`HTTP 200`).
   - `releases/latest` remains `stockfish-18`.
6. Cleanup requirements:
   - Remove local temp/download artifacts.
   - Remove temporary probe releases/tags created during auth or API format checks.
